# Introduction
Hi human, I'm Umar Khatab - A Full-stack Blockchain Engineer for over 3 years.

I Love building scalable custom Blockchain solutions and securing existing Blockchain protocols.

I have started a YouTube channel [ Blockchain Ninja ](https://www.youtube.com/@blockchain-ninja/videos) where I'll be delivering in-depth explanation about several blockchain topics.

# My Career Aspects:
- Web3 Security Researcher
- Senior Blockchain Engineer
