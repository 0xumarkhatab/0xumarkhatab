## 👋 Hey, I'm Umar Khatab

I build and break smart contracts (in a good way).  
**4+ years** in Solidity + EVM, shipping real protocols, writing tests, and doing security research.

### You like the stats?
- **160+ smart contracts** shipped across EVM chains  
- **20k+ lines** of Solidity
- **Security:** found **1 High + 1 Medium** on ZeroLend via Immunefi  
- **Testing mindset:** I like measurable quality (coverage, invariants, edge cases)

---

## 🔥 What I’m focused on right now
For the last ~6 months, I’ve been the Founding EVM Engineer at **ViFi Labs** (FX onchain): https://x.com/ViFi_Labs
I worked end-to-end — **Python simulations → Solidity (Foundry) implementation**, with a strong focus on:
- **gas-efficient + modular contract design**
- **unit / integration / staging tests** (coverage **>97%**)
- **well-commented deployment scripts**
- deployed across multiple EVM testnets
Launch target: **2026**

## 🧱 Stuff I build (and enjoy building)
- Lending / borrowing markets
- AMMs (constant product + deeper mechanics)
- Cross-chain messaging / bridges
- NFTs + onchain apps
- Full-stack Web3 (Next.js / Node.js / TS)

### Projects I’m most proud of
- **Virtual Fiat Environment**
  Converting USD pegged assets to synthetic representation of local currency on-chain for instant settlement cross border txs.
  Soon to be public . Keep an eye on [ViFi Labs - X](https://x.com/ViFi_Labs)
- [**RiftLend (Multichain Lending/Borrowing)**](https://github.com/RiftLend/contracts-v1)  
  Unified interest rates across Multi-chain + stress-free lending UX  

- [**Non-Custodial Wallet**](https://github.com/0xumarkhatab/Non-Custodial-Wallet) - Metamask-like wallet that can generate accounts, hold funds, and trade assets.

- [**Multisig Cross chain Swap Bridge**](https://github.com/0xumarkhatab/MultisigCrossChainBridge) -  Decentralised protocol in solidity where you can burn Tokens on one EVM chain and mint on another chain by using multiple signatures. Currently, it contains 5 tokens across 3 different chains Totalling up to 500 Lines of solidity code.

- **MEV / DEX research & builds**

## 🛡️ Security work (bug bounties + audits)
I started learning smart contract security on my own and kept showing up in contests.

- **ZeroLend (High): Governance broken for whitelisted users**

- **ZeroLend (Medium): Unlimited minting of governance NFTs**  
  https://reports.immunefi.com/zerolend/29130-sc-medium-unlimited-minting-of-vestedzeronft

## ✍️ Writing / teaching (Ethereum-focused)
I like explaining hard things in a simple way (bytecode, accounts, gas, DEX design).

## 🤝 Let’s connect
If you’re building DeFi infra, L2 apps, or anything “EVM but harder”, I’m usually interested.
