# Introduction
Hi there , I'm Umar and I live on Planet Earth .
It's good to see you .

Professionally , i'm a Full-stack Blockchain Engineer for over 3 years.

I have built 15+ scalable web3 protocols, and have secured other Web3 protocols upto 88 Billion $ in Total Value locked.

My smart contract's security expertise are 1.5 years Old and still growing.

See , I've different aspects to my personality when it comes to profesional life .

# My Career Aspects:
- Content I've Written
- Senior Blockchain Engineer
- Web3 Security Researcher


## 1. About Me (As a Web3 Content Writer )
Starting and building in Blockchain space seems daunting at first . That's why I simplify complex concepts and strive to put them in a way that a 10-20 year non-tech person can understand.

Following is a glimpse of the type of content I deliver.
